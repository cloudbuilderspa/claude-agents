function PuzzleDifficultyManager:AdjustDifficulty(player, puzzleId, attemptCount)
    local baseConfig = CulturalPuzzles:GetPuzzleConfig(puzzleId)
    local playerProfile = self:GetPlayerProfile(player)
    
    -- Calculate difficulty adjustment
    local difficultyModifier = 1.0
    
    -- Based on attempt count
    if attemptCount > 3 then
        difficultyModifier = difficultyModifier * 0.8 -- Make easier
    elseif attemptCount > 6 then
        difficultyModifier = difficultyModifier * 0.6 -- Significantly easier
    end
    
    -- Based on player skill level
    local skillLevel = playerProfile:GetSkillLevel("puzzle_solving")
    if skillLevel < 0.3 then
        difficultyModifier = difficultyModifier * 0.7 -- Help newer players
    elseif skillLevel > 0.8 then
